# Emergency-Vehicle-Or-Not
This repository is part of the Hackathon on Computer Vision.
## Problem Statement
Classifying vehicle images as either belonging to the emergency vehicle or non-emergency vehicle category. Emergency vehicles usually includes police cars, ambulance and fire brigades.
## Application
Emergency vehicles face difficulty in passing through traffic. So differentiating a vehicle into an emergency and non emergency category can be an important component in traffic monitoring as well as self drive car systems as reaching on time to their destination is critical for these services. This may reduce the number of fatalities caused by such traffic delays.
